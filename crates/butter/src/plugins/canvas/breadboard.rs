//! Breadboard Plugin: Managing Breadboard Entities within the Canvas
//!
//! This module introduces the [`BreadboardPlugin`], a component of the larger
//! [`CanvasPlugin`](super::CanvasPlugin) ecosystem focused on the creation and management of
//! breadboard entities. It leverages event-driven systems to dynamically respond to changes and
//! user interactions, specifically handling the instantiation of breadboard entities upon the
//! loading of DSL files and adjusting their visibility within the canvas.
//!
//! For detailed information on individual parts of this plugin, please refer to the respective
//! documentation within this module.
