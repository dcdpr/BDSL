//! Canvas Plugin: Visualizing Breadboard Configurations
//!
//! Hosts the core functionality for rendering the dynamic visual representation of breadboards.
//! Through a set of sub-plugins:
//!
//! - [`BreadboardPlugin`]
//! - [`PlacePlugin`]
//! - [`AffordancePlugin`]
//! - [`ConnectionPlugin`]
//!
//! It orchestrates the visualization of the breadboard's components, enabling an intuitive and
//! interactive layout for users to explore and understand their designs. This plugin plays a
//! crucial role in bridging the gap between the abstract definitions of a breadboard DSL and their
//! tangible representation on the screen.
//!
//! For detailed information on individual parts of this plugin, please refer to the respective
//! documentation within this module.
