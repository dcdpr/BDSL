//! # Bread'n'Butter AST
//!
//! **A buttery smooth AST experience.**
//!
//! The `bnb_ast` crate provides the core Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structures for the
//! Bread'n'Butter project. It defines the data models used to represent the elements of a
//! breadboard in a software development context.
//!
//! This crate is essential for the Bread'n'Butter ecosystem, as it allows for a structured and
//! programmable way to interact with breadboard configurations.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The crate defines several primary structures:
//!
//! - [`Breadboard`]: The root node representing the entire breadboard configuration.
//! - [`Place`]: Represents a specific location or section on the breadboard.
//! - [`Component`]: Defines a reusable component that can be referenced from places.
//! - [`Affordance`]: Details an action or capability associated with a place.
//! - [`Connection`]: Represents a link from an affordance to places on the breadboard.
//! - [`Sketch`]: A graphical representation associated with a place, including clickable areas.
//! - [`Area`]: A specific clickable area within a `Sketch`.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The AST structures in this crate are primarily used by the parser and the graphical interface
//! components of the Bread'n'Butter project. They provide the necessary data models for
//! interpreting breadboard descriptions and for rendering visual representations of these
//! configurations.
//!
//! Here's a brief example of how these structures might be used:
//!
//! ```
//! use bnb_ast::{Breadboard, Place, Component, Affordance, Connection, Sketch, Area};
//!
//! // Create a new breadboard instance
//! let breadboard = Breadboard {
//!     places: vec![],
//!     components: vec![],
//! };
//!
//! // Add places and components as needed
//! // ...
//! ```
